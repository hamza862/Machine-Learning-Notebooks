# Machine-Learning-Notebooks

This is a repository of jupyter notebooks of implementation of different Machine Learning algorithms. 
These algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. 
PCA approach is also discussed in the notebooks. 
All the required datasets are also available in the repository. 
GridSearchCV and Optuna which are used to tune the hyper parameters are also discussed in the notebooks. 
The code is written in a rough way because these notebooks are for practice not for real-time problem statements.
